Hi,

Before we can conduct the user study we require you to:

1. Download and digitally sign the consent form using a PDF reader like Adobe
   Acrobat or macOS Preview: <a
   href="https://www.samlau.me/r/UT_user_study_consent.pdf"
   target="_blank">https://www.samlau.me/r/UT_user_study_consent.pdf</a>

1. Fill out the online background survey. At the bottom of the survey we will
   ask you to upload your signed consent form. To complete the survey, you will
   need a participant ID. The survey url is:
   <a href="https://forms.gle/U1WSVFy866dqScDZA">https://forms.gle/U1WSVFy866dqScDZA</a>

<!-- 1. Watch the 8-minute tutorial video on the prototype system you will work with
   during the study. To refresh your memory, we will help you replicate the
   video steps in the prototype systems, but will assume that you have watched
   the video at least once. The video URL is:
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jllH9T3zEU0 -->

**Your PID is: <span id="pid"></span>**

Please complete these steps at least thirty minutes before your interview. You can
email lau@ucsd.edu with any questions.

Looking forward to the user study!
